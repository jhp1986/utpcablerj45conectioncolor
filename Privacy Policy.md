## UTP Cable (RJ45): Privacy Policy

Welcome to the UTP Cable (RJ45) app for Android, available on Google Play.

I would like to state, to the best of my knowledge, that I have not programmed the app to collect any personally information. All data is stored on your device only, and can simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

| Permission | Why it is required |

If you find any security or privacy vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
